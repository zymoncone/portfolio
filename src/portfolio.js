                 "CrowdSecure is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform for charitable donations built " +
                 "within 24 hours at MHacks16, a Univerisity of Michigan hosted hackathon with over " +
                 "350 participants. " +
                 "Here's what we did: \n~CrowdSecure uses Hedera and GitCoin: The platform leverages " +
                 "Hedera‚Äôs decentralized network and GitCoin‚Äôs quadratic funding match model to ensure " +
                 "transparency and security in donations2. Hedera provides fast and low-cost transactions, " +
                 "while GitCoin provides a democratic way to allocate funds from sponsors to social campaigns." +
                 "\n~CrowdSecure aims to bridge the gap between donors and charities: The platform allows " +
                 "donors to be sure that their money is directly transferred to the rightful charity organizations, " +
                 "without intermediaries or fraud3. It also promotes accountability among the charities, who can " +
                 "showcase their impact and receive feedback from the donors." +
                 "\n~CrowdSecure is built with web3 technology: The platform is based on web3, which is the next " +
                 "generation of the internet that is more decentralized, open, and user-centric5. Web3 enables " +
                 "users to have more control and ownership over their data and assets, and to participate in " +
                 "the creation and governance of online services." +
                 "\n~CrowdSecure faced some challenges and learned a lot: The team had no prior experience with " +
                 "web3 and blockchain, but they learned a lot about the concept and the potential of this technology " +
                 "for social good. They also faced some difficulties in integrating GitCoin with Hedera, and in " +
                 "deploying their frontend with Streamlit. They are proud of their successful proof-of-concept " +
                 "and hope to continue improving their platform.",
